As the night falls and silence covers everything, in my dream I become an adventurer. I crossed far-off mountains, explored unknown forests and interacted with various creatures I met along the way. Sometimes making friendships, sometimes overcoming ordeals, I am breath taken by the fantastic landscapes that I can only see in my dreams. Although the destinations are always changing, the experience of travelling enriches my mind and adds a new colour to my days in the real world.
