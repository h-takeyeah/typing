Throughout the year, the change of seasons always brings fresh surprises. The arrival of spring melts away the cold of winter and brings flowers into bloom. Summer gives energy to activities in the sunshine, and autumn signals the end of the year through the carpet of fallen leaves. And when winter arrives, the serenity of snow envelops everything. Each season has its own unique beauty and rhythm of life.
