Brewing a cup of tea in the afternoon is a special moment to get away from the busyness of everyday life and calm down. As the hot tea is poured into the cup, the warm steam fills the air and the subtle aroma soothes the soul. Through this quiet time, you face yourself and temporarily escape from the hustle and bustle of everyday life. Tea time is not just a rest, but a ritual for self-renewal.
